## Roles

Roles are collections of permissions that define what actions a user can perform. Each role can have multiple permissions, and each user can have multiple roles. Examples of roles include:

- **Admin:**

## User Management

User management involves the creation and maintenance of user accounts. Only administrators can create and manage user accounts. Users cannot sign up on their own.

### User Creation

Administrators can create new user accounts by providing the following information:

- Username
- Email
- Password
- Assigned Roles

### User Management Features

- **View Users:** Administrators can view a list of all users.
- **Add Users:** Administrators can create new user accounts.
- **Edit Users:** Administrators can update user information and roles.
- **Delete Users:** Administrators can delete user accounts.

## Dynamic Management

The system allows for dynamic management of users, roles, and permissions. Administrators can:

- Create new roles and assign permissions to them.
- Update existing roles and their permissions.
- Assign multiple roles to users.
- Update user roles as needed.

## Security Considerations

- **Role-Based Access Control:** Ensure that users can only access features and data based on their assigned roles.
- **Audit Trails:** Maintain logs of role and permission changes for auditing purposes.
- **Secure Authentication:** Use secure methods for user authentication and password management.
- **Session Management:** Implement session management and timeout controls to enhance security.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides an overview of the user and RBAC management system for the Poultry Management Information System (MIS). It covers the scope, permissions, roles, and user management functionalities, ensuring a secure and dynamic approach to access control within the system.
