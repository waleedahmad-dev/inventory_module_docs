**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 18, 2025

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the design and implementation of the Inventory Management Module for your supplier management system. The module will enable real-time tracking and management of inventory across multiple branches and warehouses in a poultry and feed production environment.

### 1.2 Scope

The module covers:

- **Branches & Warehouses:** Management of multiple branches, each with one or more warehouses.
- **Items & Products:** Creation and maintenance of raw materials (items) and finished goods (products).
- **Inventory Stock:** Real-time tracking and updates of stock levels.
- **Stock Transfers:** Seamless transfer of stock between branches/warehouses.
- **Order Management:** Processing of supplier orders and customer orders.
- **Production Management:** Coordination of production processes that affect inventory.
- **Inventory Transactions:** Recording adjustments, corrections, and movement histories.
- **Item Units & Price Changes:** Management of measurement units and historical price modifications.

### 1.3 Audience

This documentation is intended for system architects, developers, quality assurance engineers, project managers, and key business stakeholders.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The Inventory Management Module is a standalone component that integrates with your existing user authentication, accounting, and other business systems. It consists of:

- **Presentation Layer:** Web UI (or mobile interface) for inventory operations.
- **Business Logic Layer:** Service components implementing inventory rules, validations, and workflows.
- **Data Access Layer:** Interfaces to the central database, including APIs for CRUD operations.
- **Integration Layer:** RESTful API endpoints for connecting with supplier, customer, production, and accounting modules.

Figure 1 below illustrates the high-level architecture.

## 5. Data Model

### 5.1 Key Entities

- **Branch:** Represents each physical location.
- **Warehouse:** Each branch’s storage facility.
- **Item:** Raw materials used in production.
- **Product:** Finished goods produced.
- **InventoryRecord:** Current stock levels for items/products.
- **Transfer:** Records of stock transfers between warehouses/branches.
- **Order:** Supplier and customer order details.
- **ProductionOrder:** Details related to production activities.
- **Transaction:** Logs of all inventory changes.
- **Unit:** Units of measurement for items.
- **PriceChange:** Historical records of price modifications.

### 5.2 Relationships

- A Branch can have multiple Warehouses.
- Each Warehouse holds multiple InventoryRecords associated with Items or Products.
- Orders and ProductionOrders trigger Transactions that update InventoryRecords.

An ER diagram (see Appendix B) details these relationships.

## 6. API and Integration

### 6.1 RESTful Endpoints

- **Branch API:** `/api/branches` – CRUD operations for branches.
- **Warehouse API:** `/api/warehouses` – Manage warehouses within branches.
- **Item/Product API:** `/api/items` and `/api/products` – Manage item/product data.
- **Inventory API:** `/api/inventory` – Retrieve and update stock levels.
- **Transfer API:** `/api/transfers` – Handle stock transfers.
- **Order API:** `/api/orders` – Manage supplier and customer orders.
- **Production API:** `/api/production` – Create and monitor production orders.
- **Transaction API:** `/api/transactions` – Log and query inventory transactions.
- **Price API:** `/api/prices` – Record and view price changes.

### 6.2 Integration Points

- **Accounting System:** Synchronize inventory valuations and transactions.
- **Supplier/Customer Management:** Share order status and related data.
- **Production Systems:** Automatically adjust inventory based on production outputs.

## 7. Use Cases

### 7.1 Branch Creation
